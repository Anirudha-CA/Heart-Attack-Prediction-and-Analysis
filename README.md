# Heart-Attack-Prediction-and-Analysis
A data science project on the topic of heart attack prediction and analysis. The exploratory data analysis and the machine learning predictions are the highlights of this project.
Certainly! Here's an example README file for a Jupyter Notebook project called "Heart Attack Analysis using Machine Learning":

# Heart Attack Analysis using Machine Learning

This project aims to analyze and predict the occurrence of heart attacks based on various health factors using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis contains several medical attributes, such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more, along with the target variable indicating the presence or absence of a heart attack.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset). It consists of records from individuals and their corresponding health attributes.

The dataset contains the following columns:
- age: Age of the patient
- sex: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)
- cp: Chest pain type (0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic)
- trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
- chol: Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl)
- fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
- restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)
- thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
- exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = upsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = downsloping)
- ca: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3)
- thal: Thalassemia (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversable defect)
- target: Presence of heart attack (1 = yes, 0 = no)

## Machine Learning Techniques

This project utilizes the following machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict heart attacks:

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: The dataset is visualized to gain insights into the relationships between variables and their impact on heart attacks.
3. Feature Selection: Important features are selected using techniques such as correlation analysis or feature importance rankings.
4. Model Training: Several machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, are trained on the dataset.
5. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning: The model with the best performance is selected and fine-tuned by optimizing its hyperparameters.
7. Prediction: The selected model is used to predict heart attacks on unseen data.

## Dependencies

The following libraries and packages are required to run the Jupyter Notebook:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

These dependencies can be installed using the `pip` package manager. For example:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.
2. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Heart Attack Analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
4. Run each cell in the

 notebook sequentially to execute the code and observe the results.
5. Follow the comments and instructions within the notebook to understand the analysis process and interpret the results.
6. Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different machine learning algorithms, or explore additional visualizations.
